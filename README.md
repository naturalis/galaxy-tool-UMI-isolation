# galaxy-tool-UMI-isolation
This repository contains a Galaxy specific xml file that can be used to install
Caltha on the Naturalis Galaxy instance.  
A description and further text about Caltha can be found on the
main [repository](https://github.com/JasperBoom/caltha).  

## Old description (before Caltha)
Use a python script to accumulate all UMIs and output a tabular file, a BLAST
file and a zip file. The tabular file will contain all unique UMI nucleotides,
a count of the number of reads that are associated with that UMI and a read
that represents the sequences associated with that umi. The BLAST file can be
used to identify all UMI clusters. The zip file will contain fastA files for
every unique UMI and contain reads associated with
that UMI.

About this repository:

This repo is kept as a backup to guarantee continuity for Naturalis.
Active development on this tool is done in the Caltha package:
